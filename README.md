A clone of Minsweeper written in Vue. It's a no-backend app that uses localStorage to save the best game scores.

It currently runs on https://pixel-rain.github.io/minesweeper/

It's a Vue-CLI version of the original app that I have developed on Codepen.io, it's Codepen version is in another repository https://github.com/pixel-rain/codepen-and-other-minor-stuff/tree/master/vue-minesweeper

As a Vue-CLI project it follows the usual commands: 'npm run serve' to launch it in the development mode and 'npm run build' to build the app for production.
